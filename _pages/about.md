Hii! Welcome to my chaotic little archive of life experiences and works.
I am a first year PhD candidate in the team ([Epione](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/)) at Inria Sophia-Antipolis, France. I am working on multi-modal image registration specifically MRI and Ultrasound Images.

My master's degree is in the Application of AI in Medical Imaging ([MAIA](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/)) funded by the European Union and coordinated by the University of Girona, Spain. During this program, I lived, studied and worked in 4 different countries: France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. I did my master's thesis in Active CT Reconstruction at [WEISS, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/interventional-surgical-sciences).


 I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision and in the recent years, I have been studying and developing projects on their application in Medical Imaging Technology. 

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines Nepal](https://fusemachines.com/).
