Hii! Welcome to my chaotic little archive of life experiences and works.
I am a second-year Master's student doing my master's thesis in Active CT Reconstruction at [WEISS, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/interventional-surgical-sciences). My master's degree is in the Application of AI in Medical Imaging ([MAIA](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/)) funded by the European Union and coordinated by the University of Girona, Spain. I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision and during my master's I have been studying and developing projects on their application in Medical Imaging Technology. 

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Fusemachines Nepal](https://fusemachines.com/).
